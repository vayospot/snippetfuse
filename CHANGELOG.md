## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-01

### Added

- **New Feature**: Added a **`Add Files from Project`** button to the Additional context section, allowing to select multiple project files at once via a quick-pick list.
- **UX Improvement**: Webview state is now **persistent**. Snippets, notes, prompt choices, and input fields are preserved when the side panel is closed or the views is switched.

### Fixed

- **Performance**: The project file scanner now **respects `.gitignore`** rules, significantly speeding up file discovery and excluding large, unnecessary directories like `node_modules`.
